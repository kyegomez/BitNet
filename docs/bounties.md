# Bounty Program

Our bounty program is an exciting opportunity for contributors to help us build the future of Zeta. By participating, you can earn rewards while contributing to a project that aims to revolutionize digital activity.

Here's how it works:

1. **Check out our Roadmap**: We've shared our roadmap detailing our short and long-term goals. These are the areas where we're seeking contributions.

2. **Pick a Task**: Choose a task from the roadmap that aligns with your skills and interests. If you're unsure, you can reach out to our team for guidance.

3. **Get to Work**: Once you've chosen a task, start working on it. Remember, quality is key. We're looking for contributions that truly make a difference.

4. **Submit your Contribution**: Once your work is complete, submit it for review. We'll evaluate your contribution based on its quality, relevance, and the value it brings to Zeta.

5. **Earn Rewards**: If your contribution is approved, you'll earn a bounty. The amount of the bounty depends on the complexity of the task, the quality of your work, and the value it brings to Zeta.

## The Three Phases of Our Bounty Program

### Phase 1: Building the Foundation
In the first phase, our focus is on building the basic infrastructure of Zeta. This includes developing key components like the Zeta class, integrating essential tools, and establishing task completion and evaluation logic. We'll also start developing our testing and evaluation framework during this phase. If you're interested in foundational work and have a knack for building robust, scalable systems, this phase is for you.

### Phase 2: Enhancing the System
In the second phase, we'll focus on enhancing Zeta by integrating more advanced features, improving the system's efficiency, and refining our testing and evaluation framework. This phase involves more complex tasks, so if you enjoy tackling challenging problems and contributing to the development of innovative features, this is the phase for you.

### Phase 3: Towards Super-Intelligence
The third phase of our bounty program is the most exciting - this is where we aim to achieve super-intelligence. In this phase, we'll be working on improving the swarm's capabilities, expanding its skills, and fine-tuning the system based on real-world testing and feedback. If you're excited about the future of AI and want to contribute to a project that could potentially transform the digital world, this is the phase for you.

Remember, our roadmap is a guide, and we encourage you to bring your own ideas and creativity to the table. We believe that every contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference. So join us on this exciting journey and help us create the future of Zeta.

## Bounties for Roadmap Items

To accelerate the development of Zeta and to encourage more contributors to join our journey towards automating every digital activity in existence, we are announcing a Bounty Program for specific roadmap items. Each bounty will be rewarded based on the complexity and importance of the task. Below are the items available for bounty:

1. **Multi-Agent Debate Integration**: $2000
2. **Meta Prompting Integration**: $1500
3. **Zeta Class**: $1500
4. **Integration of Additional Tools**: $1000
5. **Task Completion and Evaluation Logic**: $2000
6. **Ocean Integration**: $2500
7. **Improved Communication**: $2000
8. **Testing and Evaluation**: $1500
9. **Worker Swarm Class**: $2000
10. **Documentation**: $500

For each bounty task, there will be a strict evaluation process to ensure the quality of the contribution. This process includes a thorough review of the code and extensive testing to ensure it meets our standards.

# 3-Phase Testing Framework

To ensure the quality and efficiency of the Swarm, we will introduce a 3-phase testing framework which will also serve as our evaluation criteria for each of the bounty tasks.

## Phase 1: Unit Testing
In this phase, individual modules will be tested to ensure that they work correctly in isolation. Unit tests will be designed for all functions and methods, with an emphasis on edge cases.

## Phase 2: Integration Testing
After passing unit tests, we will test the integration of different modules to ensure they work correctly together. This phase will also test the interoperability of the Swarm with external systems and libraries.

## Phase 3: Benchmarking & Stress Testing
In the final phase, we will perform benchmarking and stress tests. We'll push the limits of the Swarm under extreme conditions to ensure it performs well in real-world scenarios. This phase will measure the performance, speed, and scalability of the Swarm under high load conditions.

By following this 3-phase testing framework, we aim to develop a reliable, high-performing, and scalable Swarm that can automate all digital activities. 

# Reverse Engineering to Reach Phase 3

To reach the Phase 3 level, we need to reverse engineer the tasks we need to complete. Here's an example of what this might look like:

1. **Set Clear Expectations**: Define what success looks like for each task. Be clear about the outputs and outcomes we expect. This will guide our testing and development efforts.

2. **Develop Testing Scenarios**: Create a comprehensive list of testing scenarios that cover both common and edge cases. This will help us ensure that our Swarm can handle a wide range of situations.

3. **Write Test Cases**: For each scenario, write detailed test cases that outline the exact steps to be followed, the inputs to be used, and the expected outputs.

4. **Execute the Tests**: Run the test cases on our Swarm, making note of any issues or bugs that arise.

5. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on the results of our tests, iterate and improve our Swarm. This may involve fixing bugs, optimizing code, or redesigning parts of our system.

6. **Repeat**: Repeat this process until our Swarm meets our expectations and passes all test cases.

By following these steps, we will systematically build, test, and improve our Swarm until it reaches the Phase 3 level. This methodical approach will help us ensure that we create a reliable, high-performing, and scalable Swarm that can truly automate all digital activities.

Let's shape the future of digital automation together!
